# Awesome Books
## Awesome books: a complete website with navigation

In this project, We are taking the Awesome books application and convert it into a fully functional website. We are refactoring the project to add three new sections on top of the two sections you have already completed: Books list (done), Add book form (done), a new Contact info section, a Navigation bar, and a Footer.

## Learning objects

- Understand the concept of single page application.
- Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements.
- Use JavaScript events.

## Basic Works
 - Add book, Remove book
 - Data preserve to local storage
 - When page refreshed local storage data can be displayed
 - Section management in the same page via javascript   manipulations.
