# Awesome Books
## Awesome books: plain JavaScript with objects

In this project, We are build a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. We are achieve that by using JavaScript objects and arrays. And also we are are using it to dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events.

## Basic Works
 - Add book, Remove book
 - Data preserve to local storage
 - When page refreshed local storage data can be displayed
